        <p>In 2014 I was in the digital cinematography program at Full Sail University.
          I went to film school not to become an actor, or a director. I went to become
          a producer. To be a good producer you have to know how to do everything, and in
          film school you are required to do everything.</p>

          <p>One of the requirements for the program is creating a youtube channel to
            post are homework assignment on. This could be anything from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU2kPY7qh8c" target="_blank">
            doing sound design</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziJR-aC5YpU" target="_blank">
            editing</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJq-63OcOw" target="_blank">
            directing a commercial</a>. I was fine with all of this, because I'm a
            behind the camera kind of guy. But I knew the time was going to come,
            that I had to step infront of the camera. I didn't have a choice about
            it. It was part of getting my degree.</p>
