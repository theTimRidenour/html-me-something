        <p>In 2014 I was in the digital cinematography program at Full Sail University.
          I went to film school not to become an actor, or a director. I went to become
          a producer. To be a good producer you have to know how to do everything, and in
          film school you are required to do everything.</p>

          <p>One of the requirements for the program is creating a youtube channel to
            post are homework assignment on. This could be anything from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU2kPY7qh8c" target="_blank">
            doing sound design</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziJR-aC5YpU" target="_blank">
            editing</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrJq-63OcOw" target="_blank">
            directing a commercial</a>. I was fine with all of this, because I'm a
            behind the camera kind of guy. But I knew the time was going to come,
            that I had to step infront of the camera. I didn't have a choice about
            it. It was part of getting my degree.</p>

            <p>Knowing I was going to have to get in front of the camera I decided
              to start making youtube videos. The problem was I didn't know what type of videos to
              make. One day a video my Furious Pete was recommended to me. I've never heard
              of him before this, but I really enjoyed the video. Pete was trying to make a free standing loop
              out of Pringles. I knew that was going to be my first video. It was
              supprisingly difficult to complete this feet. It took me over 6 hours
              under hot studio lights I setup in my room. I got around three views in a week.</p>

            <p>I have a brand new channel with one video and three views, and made the decision
              that if I get to 100 subscribers in the next three and a half months, I would go to
              VidCon in California the next year. I thought 'there's no way this is going to happen.'
              But I wanted to give myself a challenge. The next day I shot and posted
              my second video. It was taking on the cinnamon challenge, since that what was popular at the time.
              The next morning the video had over two-thousand views, and I was already
              at 48 subscribers. In two months I had close to 300 subscribers, and decided
              that I would go to PlayList Live in Florida that November, and to VidCon
              the next year.</p>
